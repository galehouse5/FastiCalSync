# Fast iCalendar Sync

Synchronizes iCalendar data with Google Calendar faster than Google Calendar's built-in sync mechanism. Aims to address the numerous complaints about slow synchronization speed on the Google Calendar Product Forum: [Why does it take so long for Google Calendar to refresh iCal links?](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/calendar/VNHydDCukDU), [Google Calendar not updating published calendar added by URL](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/calendar/ixQnzHmWDSk), [iCAL sync frequency on Google Calendar](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/calendar/7SgPSL-VgaY).
